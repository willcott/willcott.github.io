    <h2>About the Game of Life</h2>

    <p>
        The Game of Life is set in an infinite two-dimensional grid inhabited by “cells”.
        <br>
        Each cell interacts with its neighbours to determine the next state of the grid.
        <br>
        <br>
        If a living cell has less than two neighbours, there is underpopulation, so the cell dies.
        <br>
        <br>
        If a living cell has has more than three neighbours, there is overcrowding, so the cell dies.
        <br>
        <br>
        A cell is born where there is an empty position with three neighbours.
    </p>

    <h2>How it was Implemented</h2>

    <p>
        This implementation was achieved by storing the coordinates of live cells in an array.
        <br>
        <br>
        To compute the next iteration, the number of neighbours of each living cell is checked.
        <br>
        <br>
        If the number of neighbours is not two or three, then the live cell is removed from the array.
        <br>
        <br>
        The only way a dead cell can come to life is if it has neighbouring live cells.
        <br>
        <br>
        Therefore each neighbour of the live nodes has its number of neighbours checked, if it is three, it is added to the array.
