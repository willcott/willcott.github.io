        "In my third year of my degree, I took a module in which we were tasked we recreating the audio of a clip from a film, in a small team. The clip we chose was from the film Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, which features some very exagerated sound design that we believed would be a great challenge to recreate. We had to strip out all the audio and recreate everything from scratch ourselves.<br><br> We recreated impacts for the fight scene, re-dubbed the dialogue and recorded atmosphere to fill the gaps, and much much more. It was a fun project that gave me insight into the audio post production process of films and can be seen below. I hope you enjoy!",

When you tap on one, the bird tweets a unique tune.<br><br>You can also fade in and out relaxing sounds such as a river flowing by and rain to create your own nature-inspired soundscape.<br><br>The birds that you have found are saved to the device and can be found on a page where you can tap the ones you've found to hear them tweet again.<br><br>There is an automatic mode that a user can enable where you can set your device to the side and use the sounds of nature to help you concentrate or relax."

        'In the summer of 2018, I was part of a research team in the Audio Lab at the University of York alongside Dr Jude Brereton and Dr Helena Daffern. I was tasked with producing software that would allow a live performance to be played in a virtual acoustic environment that could be changed by the conductor or performer.<br><br> I learnt about many new aspects of audio technology, including virtual acoustics and spatial audio. The software that was used was Max along with Ableton Live using IRCAM\'s Spat library. I also developed Android applications to interface with the software using Java and Android Studio. I also organised testing of the software with performers and a small audience.<br><br> This was a proof of concept project and I was successful in achieving the brief set out at the start of the project.

The track was recorded over two sessions, one session was used to record the instruments, guitars, bass, and drum kit, and the second session was used to record vocals. I then went on to mix and master the track for it to be later released on many major platforms such as Spotify, iTunes and Google Play Music.",

        "This recording was carried out as part of the Recording Studio Techniques module during my first year of BEng Elecronics with Music Technology Systems at the University of York. I used a combination of the XY mic (Rode NT4), and a spaced pair technique using two Rode NT5s. This provided a very crisp recording of both the guitar and the vocals, with a wide stereo image. The performance space was chosen to give a subtle reverb that I thought would particularly complement a soft, calm performance.",
